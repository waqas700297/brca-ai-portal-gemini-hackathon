Hello everyone, my project is called Breast Cancer AI Portal, and it’s designed to tackle one of the biggest challenges in oncology: the overwhelming complexity of breast cancer trial data. Clinicians and researchers often face mountains of pathology reports, trial records, and patient histories. The problem isn’t a lack of data—it’s the difficulty of turning that data into clear, actionable insights fast enough to impact patient care. That’s where my solution comes in. The Breast Cancer AI Portal leverages Google Gemini 3, a cutting‑edge multimodal AI model, to transform complex oncology trial data into real‑time, patient‑specific summaries and instant Q&A. With Gemini’s reasoning capabilities, the portal can parse structured trial inputs, validate tumor metrics, and deliver concise insights that clinicians can trust. For example, if a doctor wants to know the tumor volume or staging details, Gemini can instantly generate a clear, reproducible answer.

The portal is not just a concept but a working prototype. The login screen provides a secure entry point, featuring a breast cancer awareness ribbon to emphasize its clinical focus. Once inside, the main landing page offers a clean interface: trial patients are listed on the left, detailed case summaries appear in the center, and an interactive Q&A panel allows clinicians to query the AI directly. Separately, the AI configuration screen enables users to select Gemini 3, enter their API key, and customize prompt instructions for clinical summaries. This modular design ensures flexibility, security, and ease of use.  

Building it involved designing a user‑friendly interface, integrating secure endpoints with Gemini, and creating a case analysis engine that transforms trial data into summaries and Q&A. Along the way, I faced challenges like ensuring data consistency, configuring Gemini securely under time pressure, and translating technical outputs into language clinicians can rely on.  

But the accomplishments I’m proud of are clear: successfully integrating Gemini into a healthcare workflow, building a working prototype that delivers real‑time insights, and proving that AI can reduce complexity in oncology.  

Looking ahead, the next steps for Breast Cancer AI Portal include expanding integration with electronic medical records, adding multimodal support for images and genomics, and collaborating with healthcare institutions to pilot the portal in real clinical trials.  

In short: The problem is data overload, the solution is AI clarity, and the tool is Breast Cancer AI Portal powered by Google Gemini 3.
